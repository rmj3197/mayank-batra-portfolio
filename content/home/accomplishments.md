  - Developed innovative multiple views android app which accepted persistent data from either Sqlite DB or JsonRPC enabled server and parsed data as a list using recycler view in a list adapter.
  - Developed a similar iOS app using Swift which accepted persistent data from Core Data DB or JsonRPC enabled server and parsed data as a list using UITableViewController and NavigationController to control navigation bar.
  - Both these apps calculated the Great Circle distance and Initial Bearing from one place to another

- SPARKY is an imperative programming language taking inspiration from JAVA.
- Implemented a custom compiler and runtime environment for SPARKY language.
- Salient features of the language include conditionals, loops, expressions, blocks, etc.
- Created the programming language based on the imperative paradigm and provided dynamic data binding for the variables of type Integer and Boolean.
- Capable of handling exceptions for various errors and exceptions.
- Tools used:Eclipse, Antlr, Git, ANT
